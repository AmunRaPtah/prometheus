# 2026-06-23: the index/embed build on the grown corpus peaks just over the old 1.5G
# RAM + 512M swap cap and was being SIGKILLed (exit 137) every run before completing.
# Bumped RAM ceiling to 2G and swap allowance to 2G so it spills to (compressed zram)
# swap and FINISHES, while still capped well below box limits. MemoryMax keeps real
# RAM bounded; MemorySwapMax stops it eating the whole swap pool.
# 2026-07-04 (post-wipe rebuild): this box has NO swap configured (Swap: 0B), so the
# 2G+2G RAM/swap design could not spill and was SIGKILLed (exit 137) at ~2.1G every run.
# Give it the full 2G+2G working-set budget as real RAM (4G) instead — box has ~7.8G,
# so 4G is still safely below box limits. If swap is later restored, MemorySwapMax reapplies.
