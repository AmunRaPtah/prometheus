"""LLM-augmented reporting — DuckDB facts + DeepSeek interpretation, grounded.

Two modes, both fed the zero-token facts sheet so the model spends budget only on
reasoning:

  default : ONE DeepSeek call interprets facts + retrieved excerpts -> report (cheap).
  agent   : a bounded Claude Code harness on the DeepSeek backend digs deeper, with
            read-only query access and capped turns (opt-in; more tokens).

If no LLM credentials are present, a facts-only report is still produced (no tokens).
