# shared box already running a media stack that overcommits RAM and the kernel OOM-kills
# the harvest mid-build (see the 2026-06-22 incident). Capping memory_limit makes DuckDB
# *spill its hash joins/aggregations to `temp_directory` on disk* instead of allocating
# past the ceiling, so the build stays within the harvest's 1.5 GB cgroup scope and never
# triggers a global OOM. Both knobs are env-overridable for one-off heavy manual runs.
